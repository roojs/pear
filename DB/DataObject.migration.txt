Migrating DataObjects to use PDO
?? change to PDO_DataObject ???   in theory DB_DataObject extends PDO_DataObjects can be used to support it?

** replaces DB as the backend?

_build_select
-> quoteIdentifiers


find -
-> modifyLImitQuery
-> cleaning of RESULTS object?

fetch
-> use of result->fetchRow() (query and statement object in pdo)
-> catching of end of results.
-> clearing resultfields 
-> in theory it could fetch into the object.?? = however we covert '.' to '_' ... may be an issue in some scenarios?
BC?


selectAs
-> quoteIdentifier

insert
-> determine Dbtype ( for empty insert)
-> quoteIdentifier
-> sequence inserts and setOption seqname_format..... ??
-> dbtype - used to deterime method to get inserted id

update
-> quoteIdentifier

delete
-> quoteIdentifier
-> modifyLimitQuery / setLimit ??

count
-> 


-----
Things that need implementations (not really provided by PDO?)
quoteIdentifiers
modifyLimitQuery





Other Changes
-> move globals -> static instances props..
-> constants to -> object constants..

?? overload support ?? 
 -- removed - in theory you can just wrap dataobjects, and add the two methods....
 ** we can remove _call and  why is __sleep defined as it is??

fetchRow
-> ?? should we event support this??? depricate?
 










STAGE 2:
- use 'prepared' statements rather than constructing the SQL
  ** this may be problematic as methods may need changing... like 'whereAdd' etc...
